# **LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:**

| LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS | Description |
| --- | --- |
| LLR\_1\_ Arithmetic Operations | Addition:Input validation: check the ASCII value range of the user input numbers.
Input type: integer, float.
Operation: Take two inputs from the user and check the data type.
If the inputs are in float data type; the results will be in floating point.If the inputs are in integer data type; the result will be in integer data type.If the inputs are in combination of integer as well as floating type; then the result should be in floating type.

|
 | Subtraction:Input validation: check the ASCII value range of the user input numbers.
Input type: integer, float.
Operation: Take two inputs from the user and check the data type.Sign of both the input values must be considered and accordingly the subtraction operation must be performed.
If the inputs are in float data type; the results will be in floating point.If the inputs are in integer data type; the result will be in integer data type.If the inputs are in combination of integer as well as floating type; then the result should be in floating type.

 | Multiplication:
Input validation: Check the ASCII value range of the user input numbers.Also check the sign of the user input numbers.
Input type: integer, float.
Operation: Take two inputs from the user and check the data type.Sign of both the input values must be considered and accordingly the multiplication operation must be performed.
If the inputs are in float data type; the results will be in floating point.If the inputs are in integer data type; the result will be in integer data type.If the inputs are in combination of integer as well as floating type; then the result should be in floating type.

|
 | Division:
Input Validation: Check the ASCII value range of the user input numbers.Also check the sign of the user input numbers.Divide by zero is not possible.
Input type: integer, float.
Operation: Take two inputs from the user and check the data type.Sign of both the input values must be considered and accordingly the division operation must be performed.
If the inputs are in float data type; the results will be in floating point.If the inputs are in integer data type; the result will be in integer data type.If the inputs are in combination of integer as well as floating type; then the result should be in floating type.

| LLR\_6\_Memory Storage | A history button is created which shows the last five stored results.When the user hits the HISTORY button it will display the last five stored value.
Operation: Works with arrays. |
